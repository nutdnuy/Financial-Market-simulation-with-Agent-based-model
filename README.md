A Python-based agent-based market simulation that models the interactions of various agent types and their impact on market prices over time. The project provides a framework to study the dynamics of a trading market with customizable parameters for agents and trading strategies.

## Features

- **Agent Types**:
  - Technical
  - Fundamental
  - High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
  - Programmatic Technical
  - Passive Investors

- **Customizable Parameters**:
  - Initial price, fair value, and total shares available for trading.
  - Number of agents and specific configurations for each agent type (e.g., wealth, position, short limits).

- **Simulation**:
  - Models market price evolution based on the aggregated actions of agents.
  - Visualizes market prices and trading volume over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
